        description: "The Baltit Fort of Karimabad is situated in the Hunza valley, a remote region within the Northern Areas of Pakistan, close to the border with China. The Hunza Valley reflects the dramatic terrain of the Karakoram Mountain Range, through which the mighty Indus River runs. Prone to natural disasters Â­ floods, rock falls, avalanches, and landslides - the area also offers spectacular vistas of steep slopes, rugged peaks, snake-like glaciers, and precipitous gorges, making it one of the world's most rugged areas."

The town is made up of stone walled steep sloping large terraces.[1] The town was a caravan halting place for people who were traveling through the Hindu Kush mountains to the Vale of Kashmir. It is set amidst snow clad mountain peaks of Rakaposhi (altitude of about 25,000 feet (7,600 m)), and glaciers like the Ulter Nala as a backdrop, and deep gorges. Access is by hill road from Gilgit."

        description: "The Khunjerab Pass is the highest paved international border crossing in the world and the highest point on the Karakoram Highway. The roadway across the pass was completed in 1982, and has superseded the unpaved Mintaka and Kilik passes as the primary passage across the Karakoram Range. The choice of Khunjerab Pass for Karakoram Highway was decided in 1966: China citing the fact that Mintaka would be more susceptible to air strikes, recommended the steeper Khunjerab Pass instead."
